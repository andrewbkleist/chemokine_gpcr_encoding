<h4>Variant information for all human chemokines and receptors was
gathered for genome-wide statistical associations between variants and
disease- or phenotypic-associated traits. Associations are based on data
from ~500,000 individuals from the GeneATLAS database (made available
via UK Biobank) (Canela-Xandri et al., 2018. <em>Nature Genetics</em>).
Only missense variants were considered. All listed
disease-/phenotype-associated variants are below thresholds for
